<h1> Pluto </h1> 

<p>
    Pluto is a 3-year-old F1 goldendoodle who lives in Ohio with his family. He loves to play, go on runs, take car rides, and sleep! His favorite season is summer because he can play outside all day and make lots of neighborhood friends. <br><br>

    His favorite foods are hard-boiled eggs and cheese, and he refuses to eat his silly dry food without the addition of these delicacies in his meal. He also loves to drink water, anytime - all the time. As a puppy, he loved water so much that he would sneak into the bathroom and drink from the "biggest watter bowl around" AKA the toilet bowl. <br> <br>
