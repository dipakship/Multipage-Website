    <h1> Information about Goldendoodles </h1>

    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p> 
        Goldendoodles are "designer dogs," being a hybrid of a golden retriever and poodle, meaning they are not purebred - but rather a crossbreed.. They are known to be extrememly friendly, smart, and family dogs. Additionally, goldendoodles generally do not shed, or if they do they shed very minimally as compared to the traditional golden retriever.

    <h2> Temperment </h2>
    <p>
        Goldendoodles are very popular mainly due to their temperment and personalities. Goldendoodles are very friends, intelligent, and accepting creatures. They are also known to be highly affectionate, gentle, and patient - hence making them such good family dogs. <br> <br>
        While these traits are common among goldendoodles, the behavior of each individual dog is affected by a variety of factors including heredity, training, and socialization. Thus, it is very important to treat each dog well and start socialization early. The more a dog is exposed to different places, people, sights, and sounds, the more well-rounded the dog is likely to grow up. Enrolling puppies into puppy classes are highly encouraged, as well as taking the puppy on walks and stores. 
    </p>

    <h2> Care </h2>
    <p>
        Due to their golden retriever heritage, goldendoodles are usually very easy to train with positive reinforcement. <br>
        Important things to consider that are necessary for goldendoodles are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Socialization
            </li>
            <li>
                Exercise
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Goldendoodles have high energy levels, and hence require daily exercise for at least 30 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Space
                <ul>
                    Since goldendoodles are generally a medium to large sized breed, they are not ideal pets to live in apartments but rather it would be better for them to live in a house with a large yard of some kind.
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>
